# PROG 01: Crunch Time (App renamed to Calorie Killer)

![The app logo](/images/calorie_killer.png)

This is a simple Android app that that converts the amounts of exercise you performed into the number of calories you burned from doing that exercise, and *vice versa*.  The app works in both portrait orientation and landscape orientation.

To use the app, first (of course) open the app, which has an icon of a flaming letter C (which I made in GIMP, by the way).

You can choose which mode you want to use: **Exercise amount to calories** mode or **Calories to exercise amount** mode.  This choice can be made from the first drop down menu.

If you choose **Exercise amount to calories** mode, you will also see a second drop down menu, in which you can select the exercise type you did.

Then tap on the text field near the top of the screen (under the title of the app), and type in whatever number (can be a decimal or whole number) you want.  Once you are satisfied with the number you inputted, press the **CONVERT** button.

If you are in **Exercise amount to calories** mode, you will see something like this:

If you are in **Calories to exercise amount** mode, you will see something like this:

As you may have noticed, the units (reps, minutes, or calories burned) change depending on what is selected.
